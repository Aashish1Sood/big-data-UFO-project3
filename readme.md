# Visualization of UFO Sighting Data

In this project we generated 10 different typesofvisualizations for the UFO sigtings data based upon different features.

Also we built a catalogue of 3500 Images scraped from UFOStalker using ImageCat(https://github.com/chrismattmann/imagecat)

And then we used this index of images and built a dashboard where we were able to search similar images using flann index.
